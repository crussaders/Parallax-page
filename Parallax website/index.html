        <h2>City</h2>
        <p>
            A city is a place where many people live together.<br>
                
A city has many buildings and streets. It has houses or apartments for many people to live, shops where they may buy things, places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city, and to keep law and order in the city. People live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there.

        <h2>City  Life</h2>
        <p>
            City life – is it better? Or you think your life would have been little different if you were residing in a suburb area.

If you ask me, I vote for city life. I’m not quite made for a slow village life. I feel quite attracted to a city life considering the educational and many important opportunities it has to offer.

        <h2>Diversity</h2>
        <p>
            I like city life because of the diversity of things you can do. For example, job opportunities are better in the cities. So, if you’re a city dweller, you don’t have to leave your home in the search of better work opportunities. You’ll be able to earn the livelihood and be by the side of your family simultaneously. This was probably the biggest reason I never could go against the city life.
